In minecraft plugins, players can perform many actions in a short time period.

Therefore, caches are often implemented, which is a lot easier when using coroutines. Implementing a Cache (Bukkit) When taking a look at the Database implementation below, we can observe quite a lot of redundant database accesses when a player rejoins a server in a very short timeframe.

Therefore, MCCoroutine offers 2 custom dispatchers: minecraftDispatcher (Allows to execute coroutines on the main minecraft thread) asyncDispatcher (Allows to execute coroutines on the async minecraft threadpool) However, it is recommend to use Dispatchers.IO instead of asyncDispatcher because it is more optimized. An example how this works is shown below: fun foo () { plugin . launch { // This will always be on the minecraft main thread. val result1 = withContext ( plugin . minecraftDispatcher ) { // Perform operations on the minecraft main thread. \"Player is \" // Optionally, return a result. } // Here we are automatically back on the main thread again. val result2 = withContext ( plugin . asyncDispatcher ) { // Perform operations asynchronously. \" Max\" } // Here we are automatically back on the main thread again. println ( result1 + result2 ) // Prints 'Player is Max' } } Normally, you do not need to call plugin.minecraftDispatcher in your code. Instead, you are guaranteed to be always on the minecraft main thread in the plugin.launch{} scope and use sub coroutines (e.g. withContext) to perform asynchronous operations.

How is MCCoroutine implemented? MCCoroutine simply wraps the existing schedulers of the minecraft frameworks. For example, when you suspend a function using withContext , MCCoroutine sends new tasks to the Bukkit scheduler if necessary. Every consideration about Bukkit schedulers applies to MCCoroutine as well. Does MCCoroutine need more RAM? MCCoroutine does not create any resources like threads or threadPools. This means MCCoroutine does not have any overhead. However, Kotlin Coroutines contains additional thread pools which may increase memory usage slightly. Take a look the the official Kotlin Coroutine docs for details. Are Suspendable Listeners/Command Executors slower? No, they are as fast as ordinary listeners and command executors. The registration of them is slightly slower because reflection calls are used to create them. Once players join the server and events arrive, they are the same speed. How to cancel all running jobs? You can control the behaviour of the coroutine using plugin.scope . plugin . scope . coroutineContext . cancelChildren () How to cancel suspendable events? The following example is not possible. You cannot cancel events after you have suspended the context for the very first time. The event has already happened, and the outcome has already been decided. @EventHandler suspend fun onPlayerInteractEvent ( event : PlayerInteractEvent ) { withContext ( Dispatchers . IO ){ // e.g. read file/database delay ( 50 ) } // Cancellation is not possible at this point. event . isCancelled = true ; } Cancelling events before the first suspension is still possible. @EventHandler suspend fun onPlayerInteractEvent ( event : PlayerInteractEvent ) { // Cancellation is possible at this point. event . isCancelled = true ; withContext ( Dispatchers .

Delaying tasks If you are already in a suspend function, you can simply use delay to delay an execution. Using delay we can delay the current context (e.g. Main Thread) by some milliseconds, to easily delay actions without blocking the server. delay essentially suspends the current context and continuous after the given time. Difference between delay() and Thread.sleep() There is a big difference with delay() and Thread.sleep() . Consult the official Kotlin Coroutines documentation for details, however essentially Thread.sleep() blocks the thread for a given time and delay() suspends the thread for a given time. When a thread is suspended, it can do other work (e.g. server handles other operations like players joining or commands) compared to when a thread is blocked, it cannot do other work (e.g. server appears frozen). suspend fun sayHello () { println ( \"Please say hello in 2 seconds\" ) delay ( 2000 ) // Delay for 2000 milliseconds println ( \"hello\" ) } If you are not in a suspend function, use plugin.launch together with delay . fun sayHello () { plugin . launch { println ( \"Please say hello in 2 seconds\" ) delay ( 2000 ) // Delay for 2000 milliseconds println ( \"hello\" ) } } Delay Ticks MCCoroutine offers an extension method to use delay together with Bukkit and Sponge ticks. delay ( 1. ticks ) Prefer using delay(1.ticks) when delaying on the minecraft main thread instead of delay(50) . The tick extension function is more accurate than using milliseconds directly. The technical details are explained in this github issue . Repeating tasks If you are already in a suspend function, you can simply use traditional loops with delay to repeat tasks. suspend fun sayHello () { println ( \"Please say hello 10 times every 2 seconds\" ) for ( i in 0 until 10 ) { delay ( 2000 ) // Delay for 2000 milliseconds println ( \"hello\" ) } } If you are not in a suspend function, use plugin.launch together with delay . fun sayHello () { plugin . launch { println ( \"Please say hello 10 times every 2 seconds\" ) for ( i in 0 until 10 ) { delay ( 2000 ) // Delay for 2000 milliseconds println ( \"hello\" ) } } } Creating a Minigame using delay (Bukkit) One example where delay is really useful is when creating minigames. It makes the contract of minigame classes very easy to understand. Let's start by implementing a basic minigame class. The first example shows a countdown in the start function of the minigame. import kotlinx.coroutines.delay import org.bukkit.entity.Player class MiniGame { private var isStarted = false ; private var players = HashSet < Player > () fun join ( player : Player ) { if ( isStarted ) { return } players . add ( player ) } suspend fun start () { if ( isStarted ) { return } isStarted = true // This loop represents a traditional repeating task which ticks every 1 second and is called 20 times. for ( i in 0 until 20 ) { sendMessageToPlayers ( \"Game is starting in ${ 20 - i } seconds.\" ) delay ( 1000 ) } // ... Teleport players to game. } private fun sendMessageToPlayers ( message : String ) { players . forEach { p -> p . sendMessage ( message ) } } } Add a run function to the MiniGame class We can extend the start method to call run which contains a loop to tick the miniGame every 1 second. import kotlinx.coroutines.delay import org.bukkit.entity.Player class MiniGame { private var isStarted = false ; private var players = HashSet < Player > () private var remainingTime = 0 //... suspend fun start () { if ( isStarted ) { return } isStarted = true // This loop represents a traditional repeating task which ticks every 1 second and is called 20 times. for ( i in 0 until 20 ) { sendMessageToPlayers ( \"Game is starting in ${ 20 - i } seconds.\" ) delay ( 1000 ) } // ... Teleport players to game. run () } private suspend fun run () { remainingTime = 300 // 300 seconds while ( isStarted && remainingTime > 0 ) { sendMessageToPlayers ( \"Game is over in ${ remainingTime } seconds.\" ) delay ( 1000 ) remainingTime -- } } //... } Add a function to stop the game. An admin should be able to cancel the minigame, which we can implement by a stop function. import kotlinx.coroutines.delay import org.bukkit.entity.Player class MiniGame { private var isStarted = false ; private var players = HashSet < Player > () private var remainingTime = 0 //... private suspend fun run () { remainingTime = 300 // 300 seconds while ( isStarted && remainingTime > 0 ) { sendMessageToPlayers ( \"Game is over in ${ remainingTime } seconds.\" ) delay ( 1000 ) remainingTime -- } if ( ! isStarted ) { sendMessageToPlayers ( \"Game was cancelled by external stop.\" ) } isStarted = false // ...

Difference between delay() and Thread.sleep() There is a big difference with delay() and Thread.sleep() .
